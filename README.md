# Kickstarting with Excel

- The extensive data within the Kickstarter spreadsheet is insightful for guiding a Kickstarter campaign.  The tools within Excel bring specific pertinent data points to light to help run a successful Kickstarter.

## Overview of Project

- This project will dive into the specifics of running a successful Kickstarter campaign focused on theater, specifically plays.  The project will highlight timeframes and ranges of funding that have higher success rates to give your play Kickstarter the optimal odds for success.
 
### Purpose

- The motivation for this analysis to give the Kickstarter campaign the best opportunity for success.

## Analysis and Challenges

- The analysis covered multiple aspects centering around Kickstarter Theater outcomes.  This project took into consideration launch dates, amounts of funding needed, and the number of backers, to mention a few data points.  The project is comprised of simple formulas ranging up to complex formulas spanning across multiple data sheets to compile intriguing data points and produce compelling visuals.  The size of the data set is extensive so sifting through the vast data and dialing on the critical data related to theater was the main challenge. The tools within Excel allowed for great specific data analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- We can clearly see there is a case for when to start a campaign for a higher percentage of meeting a funding goal.  The analysis points to May being the best month for success but success is also weighted by other factors.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- Funding goals are a large driver for predicting success.  The loftier the goal the higher percentage of failure is to be expected.  Failure rates start to increase significantly at 10K+ goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The challenge with this analysis is culling out the most impactful data subsets to illustrate the best guide for a successful Kickstarter.

## Results

- The data analysis points to key building blocks for running a successful Kickstarter, mainly best start times and durations for funding campaigns along with safe funding goals.  What we can’t capture with the data set is the value brought by the creative mind behind the plays.  Along that same thinking we haven’t tied in the value of genre.  To dive deeper into the later limitation, we could further constrain the data to narrow range of funding goal and look closer at smaller data subset.  Specifically the plays blurbs and add in simple genre identifier to give more insight and potentially a better forecast for success.
